Iris Dataset
The Iris dataset is a popular and widely-used dataset in machine learning and pattern recognition. It is often used as a beginner's dataset to explore various classification algorithms. The dataset consists of measurements of four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) of three different species of Iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica).

Content
This dataset contains the following information for each sample:

Sepal length in centimeters
Sepal width in centimeters
Petal length in centimeters
Petal width in centimeters
Species: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica
Purpose
The purpose of this dataset is to provide a simple and well-known example for tasks such as classification, clustering, and visualization. It is commonly used to demonstrate various machine learning techniques and algorithms due to its simplicity and distinct classes.

Usage
The Iris dataset can be used for a variety of tasks, including:

Classification: Predicting the species of an Iris flower based on its measurements.
Clustering: Grouping similar Iris flowers together based on their features.
Visualization: Creating scatter plots, histograms, or other visualizations to explore the relationships between the different features.
Source
The Iris dataset was first introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems". The dataset is widely available in various machine learning libraries, including scikit-learn.
